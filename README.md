# File_Integrity_Checker
This project enables us to check the intergrity of the file on our sytem.  Some types of files we download, like ISO images, service packs, and of course entire software programs or operating systems, are often large and high-profile, making them prone to downloading errors and possibly even alterations by malicious third parties.
